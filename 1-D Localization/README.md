This is a 1-D Localization Problem. The map is given. User has to input the sensor values (0s and/or 1s). Once the robot figures out where it started, it will display the same. '3' is the starting point and '2' is the ending point. Accuracy of sensors/actuators is not considered in this algorithm (ie., probability of sensor and actuator are considered 1)
