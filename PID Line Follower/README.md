<h1>PID Line Follower</h1>
PID is a simple, yet very effective control method, in which a particular physical/electrical quantity is controlled, and made equal to a set value called the ‘set-point’. In this case, we will be controlling the speed of the right and left motors of the robot, so that the robot follows the center of a black line using Arduino. This is done by calculating the amount of deviation of the robot from the center of the line using IR Sensors.
