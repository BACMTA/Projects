<h1>Supernumerary Robotic Limbs - Final Year Project</h1>
Supernumerary Robotic Arms is a pair of low cost multi-purpose Robotic arms with 4 DoFs in each arm. The Robot is extendable in terms of functionality by attaching suitable end-effectors depending on the application. The actuators can be controlled wirelessly using nRF24L01 radio modules. Motion Planning is done using geometrically derived inverse kinematics. Mathematical Model and Simulations have been carried out using MATLAB Simulink and Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB.  This project was funded by the IEEE University Partnership Program ($1500). Mentor: <a href="http://www.mecheng.iisc.ernet.in/~asitava/" target="_blank">Prof. Ashitava Ghosal</a>, IISc.

A <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7283889" target="_blank">paper</a> was published on the mechanical design and kinematic model of the robot.

The robot is currently a stationary one, but it is intended to be a mobile platform, which can be worn by the user like a backpack.

Applications of this kind of robots can be seen in tasks that can be semi-automated, such as in assembly of aeroplanes, wiring of control boxes, etc.

The project was inspired by the work done by students of MIT under Prof. Harry Asada.
